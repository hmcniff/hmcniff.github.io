        <p>Hi everyone, Myrtle here. I’m an artist-writer-musician-poet-photographer, but I don’t believe in labels, so you can just think of me as a true citizen of the world.</p>
        <p>I like to spend my time poring over poetry and prose at various coffee shops, but only on the days that I'm not wearing liquid lipstick. Can't sacrifice the aesthetic for empty carbs.</p>
		<p>I am a frequent museumgoer - you can tell how often I appreciate art by the rate at which I update my Instagram feed. If I see any form of art whatsoever, you'll be the first to know. Shameless plug: follow me!</p>
		<p>I also LOVE music. Anything but country. Or Top 40 music. The more obscure bands the better.</p>
		<p>As a fledgling lifestyle guru, I'm starting a YouTube channel focusing on vlogging and vinyl/thrift hauls. I know YouTube is getting a little bit mainstream and oversaturated… But I'm so quirky and different from everyone else that my content will be inherently superior. Again, can't this stress enough: FOLLOW ME! I derive the majority of my self-worth from the validation of strangers on the internet!</p>
        <p>I hope you'll decide to join me on my winding journey through existence. Let's leave the world a little bit more enlightened than we found it, shall we?</p>
